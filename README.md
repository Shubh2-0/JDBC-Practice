📚 This GitHub repository contains two projects that demonstrate simple implementations using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

## 1. Student Management Application

🎓 The "Student Management Application" project is a basic implementation that showcases the usage of JDBC to interact with a database for managing student records. It includes functionalities such as:

- ➕ Adding a new student to the database
- 🔄 Updating an existing student's information
- ❌ Deleting a student from the database
- 🔍 Retrieving and displaying a list of all students

The project serves as a starting point for understanding the fundamental concepts of JDBC and how it can be used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

## 2. Student Management Application with DAO Pattern

🎓 The "Student Management Application with DAO Pattern" project is an enhanced version of the previous project, incorporating the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern. This pattern helps in separating the business logic from the data access code, providing a more structured and modular approach.

The key features of this project include:

- 🏗️ Implementation of a DAO layer that abstracts the database operations
- 🤝 Integration of the DAO layer with the rest of the application
- 📊 Improved code organization and maintainability through separation of concerns
- 🚀 Extensibility for incorporating additional functionality in the future

By studying this project, you can gain a deeper understanding of the DAO pattern and its benefits in managing data access in larger-scale applications.

## Usage

👣 To use these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubh2-0/JDBC-Practice.git
```

2. Open the project of your choice in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Configure the database connection details in the relevant configuration file (e.g., `db.properties`).

4. Build and run the project.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding of JDBC and the DAO pattern.
